## Bio

I love helping medical scientists and researchers with data analysis using R and Python. My passion is training and statistical analysis of medical data. I build statistical software such as dashboards for easier data visualization and analysis. My area of focus</strong> is applying data science to academic projects. I create value for medical scientists and students by enriching their projects with up to date biostatistical methods and delivering statistical analysis to bring about insights in their projects. I enjoy learning, working with fellow medical scientists, researchers and students, and making actionable plans with data.
